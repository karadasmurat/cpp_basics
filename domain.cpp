OPERATOR OVERLOADING
If an expression of the form "x op y" is encountered, the compiler will check:

  - is there a member function in the class of object x of the form "operator op(Y) where Y is the class of object y,
and, if not,
  - is there a non-member function of the form "operator op(X,Y) where X is the class of object x and Y is the class of
object y.

Since the std::string class has the move constructor, returning even the long strings by value is efficient. If an
object has a move constructor, itâ€™s said to be characterized with move-semantics. Move-semantics imply that the object
is not copied to a different location on function return, thus, providing faster function execution time.
